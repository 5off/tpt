# Text Project Template

## What is it

A template for swift writing fictional texts (novels, stories, miniatures, etc).

## Why is it

The template uses a general method of organizing things when writing source code for software. This makes it easier to use git for version control and backups. Also it makes writing much more interesting and structured like a good software engineering project.

## What is here

### Folders

- / = folder for readme.md and main.md files only
- /img = folder for images used in the text
- /lib = folder for supporting materials (library)
- /lib/scenes = folder for scenesâ€™ files
- /meta = folder for metadata files

### Files

- [/main.md](main.md) = main file, complete text with section headers
- [/README.md](README.md) = the file you are reading now, it explains what lies here and why

- [/lib/characters.md](lib/characters.md) = list of characters
- [/lib/dictionary.md](lib/dictionary.md) = dictionary of specific terms used in the writing

- [/meta/characters.yaml](meta/characters.yaml) = list of characters and their properties
